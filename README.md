This is a research project of a psychoacoustic bass enhancer based on following papers:

Basically, this algorithm adds some distortion to the low-frequency part of the spectrum in order to simulate missing low frequencies. TBH, if the distortion level is low then the bass enhancing effect is too subtle and if the distortion level too high then this is perceived as a distorted signal.
